Models: It describes the database schema and data structure.

Views: The view layer is a user interface. It controls what a user sees, the view retrieves data from appropriate models and execute any calculation made to the data and pass it to the template.

Templates: It determines how the user sees it. It describes how the data received from the views should be changed or formatted for display on the page.

Controller: Controller is the heart of the system. It handles requests and responses, setting up database connections and loading add-ons. It specifies the Django framework and URL parsing.

2. Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used if you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table.

3. Proxy models: This style is used, if you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields.

11. How can you set up the database in Djanago?
Ans: To set up a database in Django, you can use the command edit mysite/setting.py , it is a normal python module with module level representing Django settings.

By default, Django uses SQLite database. It is easy for Django users because it doesn’t require any other type of installation. In the case of other database you have to the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to match your database connection settings.

Engines: you can change database by using ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ , ‘django.db.backeneds.mysql’, ‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’ and so on

51. What is the difference between a project and an app in Django?
Ans: In Django, a project is the entire application and an app is a module inside the project that deals with one specific requirement. E.g., if the entire project is an ecommerce site, then inside the project we will have several apps, such as the retail site app, the buyer site app, the shipment site app, etc.

52. What is Django Admin Interface?
Ans: Django comes with a fully customizable in-built admin interface, which lets us see and make changes to all the data in the database of registered apps and models. To use a database table with the admin interface, we need to register the model in the admin.py file.

53. Explain Django’s Request/Response Cycle.
Ans: In the Request/Response Cycle, first, a request is received by the Django server. Then, the server looks for a matching URL in the urlpatterns defined for the project. If no matching URL is found, then a response with 404 status code is returned. If a URL matches, then the corresponding code in the view file associated with the URL is executed to build and send a response.

54. What is a model in Django?
Ans: A model is a Python class in Django that is derived from the django.db.models.Model class. A model is used in Django to represent a table in a database. It is used to interact with and get results from the database tables of our application.

55. What are migrations in Django?
Ans: A migration in Django is a Python file that contains changes we make to our models so that they can be converted into a database schema in our DBMS. So, instead of manually making changes to our database schema by writing queries in our DBMS shell, we can just make changes to our models. Then, we can use Django to generate migrations from those model changes and run those migrations to make changes to our database schema.

56. What are views in Django?
Ans: A view in Django is a class and/or a function that receives a request and returns a response. A view is usually associated with urlpatterns, and the logic encapsulated in a view is run when a request to the URL associated with it is run. A view, among other things, gets data from the database using models, passes that data to the templates, and sends back the rendered template to the user as an HttpResponse.

57. What is the use of the include function in the urls.py file in Django?
Ans: As in Django there can be many apps, each app may have some URLs that it responds to. Rather than registering all URLs for all apps in a single urls.py file, each app maintains its own urls.py file, and in the project’s urls.py file we use each individual urls.py file of each app by using the include function.

58. Why is Django called a loosely coupled framework?
Ans: Django is called a loosely coupled framework because of its MVT architecture, which is a variant of the MVC architecture. It helps in separating the server code from the client-related code. Django’s models and views take care of the code that needs to be run on the server like getting records from database, etc., and the templates are mostly HTML and CSS that just need data from models passed in by the views to render them. Since these components are independent of each other, Django is called a loosely coupled framework.

59.Mention the architecture of Django architecture?
Ans: Django architecture consists of

Models: It describes your database schema and your data structure
Views: It controls what a user sees, the view retrieves data from appropriate models and execute any calculation made to the data and pass it to the template
Templates: It determines how the user sees it. It describes how the data received from the views should be changed or formatted for display on the page
Controller: The Django framework and URL parsing
 

60. Why Django should be used for web-development?
Ans:

It allows you to divide code modules into logical groups to make it flexible to change
To ease the website administration, it provides auto-generated web admin
It provides pre-packaged API for common user tasks
It gives you template system to define HTML template for your web page to avoid code duplication
It enables you to define what URL be for a given function
It enables you to separate business logic from the HTML
Everything is in python
 

61. Explain how you can create a project in Django?
Ans: To start a project in Django, you use command $ django-admin.py and then use the command
Project
_init_.py
manage.py
settings.py
urls.py

 

62. Explain how you can set up the Database in Django?
Ans: You can use the command edit mysite/setting.py , it is a normal python module with module level representing Django settings.
Django uses SQLite by default; it is easy for Django users as such it won’t require any other type of installation. In the case your database choice is different that you have to the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to match your database connection settings

Engines: you can change database by using ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ , ‘django.db.backeneds.mysql’, ‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’ and so on
Name: The name of your database. In the case if you are using SQLite as your database, in that case database will be a file on your computer, Name should be a full absolute path, including file name of that file.
If you are not choosing SQLite as your database then setting like Password, Host, User, etc. must be added.

 

63. Give an example how you can write a VIEW in Django?
Ans: Views are Django functions that take a request and return a response.  To write a view in Django we take a simple example of “Guru99_home” which uses the template Guru99_home.html and uses the date-time module to tell us what the time is whenever the page is refreshed.  The file we required to edit is called view.py, and it will be inside mysite/myapp/

Copy the below code into it and save the file
       from datatime import datetime
      from django.shortcuts import render
     def home (request):
return render(request, ‘Guru99_home.html’, {‘right_now’: datetime.utcnow()})
Once you have determined the VIEW, you can uncomment this line in urls.py
# url ( r ‘^$’ , ‘mysite.myapp.views.home’ , name ‘Guru99’),
The last step will reload your web app so that the changes are noticed by the web server.

 

64. Explain how you can setup static files in Django?
Ans: There are three main things required to set up static files in Django

Set STATIC_ROOT in settings.py
run manage.py collectsatic
set up a Static Files entry on the PythonAnywhere web tab
 

65. Mention what does the Django templates consists of?
Ans: The template is a simple text file.  It can create any text-based format like XML, CSV, HTML, etc.  A template contains variables that get replaced with values when the template is evaluated and tags (% tag %) that controls the logic of the template.

66. Explain the use of session framework in Django?
Ans: In Django, the session framework enables you to store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis.  It stores data on the server side and abstracts the receiving and sending of cookies.  Session can be implemented through a piece of middleware.

 

67. Explain how you can use file based sessions?
Ans: To use file based session you have to set the SESSION_ENGINE settings to “django.contrib.sessions.backends.file”

68. Explain the migration in Django and how you can do in SQL?
Ans: Migration in Django is to make changes to your models like deleting a model, adding a field, etc. into your database schema.  There are several commands you use to interact with migrations.

Migrate
Makemigrations
Sqlmigrate
To do the migration in SQL, you have to print the SQL statement for resetting sequences for a given app name.
django-admin.py sqlsequencreset
Use this command to generate SQL that will fix cases where a sequence is out sync with its automatically incremented field data.

69. Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?
Ans: To load data into Django you have to use the command line Django-admin.py loaddata. The command line will searches the data and loads the contents of the named fixtures into the database.

70. Explain what does django-admin.py makemessages command is used for?
Ans: This command line executes over the entire source tree of the current directory and abstracts all the strings marked for translation.  It makes a message file in the locale directory.

71. List out the inheritance styles in Django?
Ans: In Django, there is three possible inheritance styles

Abstract base classes: This style is used when you only wants parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type out for each child model
Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used If you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table
Proxy models: You can use this model, If you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields
72. Mention what does the Django field class types?
Ans: Field class types determines

The database column type
The default HTML widget to avail while rendering a form field
The minimal validation requirements used in Django admin and in automatically generated forms
73. What constitutes Django templates ?
Ans: Template can create formats like XML,HTML and CSV(which are text based formats). In general terms template is a simple text file. It is made up of variables that will later be replaced by values after the template is evaluated and has tags which will control template’s logic.

74. List some typical usage of middlewares in Django.
Ans: Some of the typical usage of middlewares in Django are: Session management, user authentication, cross-site request forgery protection, content Gzipping, etc.

75. How do you use views in Django? 
Ans: Views will take request to return response.  Let’s write a view in Django :  “example” using template example.html , using  the date-time module to tell us exact time of reloading the page.  Let’s edit a file called view.py, and it will be inside randomsite/randomapp/
To do this save and copy following into a file:
Default

from datatime import datetime

from django.shortcuts import render

def home (request):

return render(request, ‘Guru99_home.html’, {‘right_now’: datetime.utcnow()})
Default

You have to determine the  VIEW first, and then uncomment this line located in file urls.py

# url ( r ‘^$’ , ‘randomsite.randomapp.views.home’ , name ‘example’),

76. How do you make a Django app that is test driven and will display Fibonacci’s sequence?
This will reload the site making changes obvious.

Ans: Keep in mind that it should take an index number and output the sequence. Additionally, there should be a page that shows the most recent generated sequences.

Following is one of the solution for generating fibonacci series:
Default

def fib(n):

“Complexity: O(log(n))”

if n <= 0:

return 0

i = n – 1

(a, b) = (1, 0)

(c, d) = (0, 1)

while i > 0:

if i % 2:

(a, b) = (d * b + c * a,  d * (b + a) + c * b)

(c, d) = (c * c + d * d, d * (2 * c + d))

i = i / 2

return a + b
Default

Below is a model that would keep track of latest numbers:

from django.db import models

class Fibonacci(models.Model):

parameter = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)

result = models.CharField(max_length=200)

time = models.DateTimeField()
DefaultFor view, you can simply use the following code:

 

from models import Fibonacci

def index(request):

result = None

if request.method==”POST”:

try:

n=int(request.POST.get(‘n’))

except:

return Http404

try:

result = Fibonacci.objects.get(pk=n)

result.time = datetime.now()

except DoesNotExist:

result = str(fib(n))

result = Fibonacci(n, result, datetime.now())

result.save()

return direct_to_template(request, ‘base.html’, {‘result’:result.result})
You could use models to get last ‘n’ entities.

 

77.What makes up Django architecture?
Ans: Django runs on MVC architecture. Following are the components that make up django architecture:

Models: Models elaborate back-end stuffs like database schema.(relationships)
Views: Views control what is to be shown to end-user.
Templates: Templates deal with formatting of view.
Controller: Takes entire control of Models.A MVC framework can be compared to a Cable TV with remote. A Television set is View(that interacts with end user), cable provider is model(that works in back-end) and Controller is remote that controls which channel to select and display it through view.
78. What does session framework do in django framework ?
Ans: Session framework in django will store data on server side and interact with end-users. Session is generally used with a middle-ware. It also helps in receiving and sending cookies for authentication of a user.

 

79.Can you create singleton object in python?If yes, how do you do it?
Ans: Yes, you can create singleton object. Here’s how you do it :

Default

12
3

4

5

class Singleton(object):def __new__(cls,*args,**kwargs):
if not hasattr(cls,’_inst’):

cls._inst = super(Singleton,cls).__new__(cls,*args,**kwargs)

return cls._inst

82. What do you think are limitation of Django Object relation mapping(ORM) ?
Ans: If the data is complex and consists of multiple joins using the SQL  will be clearer.

If Performance is a concern for your, ORM aren’t your choice. Genrally. Object-relation-mapping are considered good option to construct an optimized query, SQL has an upper hand when compared to ORM.

from django.conf.urls.defaults import patterns, include, url

urlpatterns = patterns(”,

url(r’^$’, ‘sampleproject.sampleapp.views.index’, name=’index’),

)

Step 6: Add index method in views.py

from django.template import RequestContext

def index(request):

welcome_msg = ‘Hello World’

return render_to_response(‘index.html’,locals(),context_instance=RequestContext(request))

Step7: Add welcome_msg in index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<body>

<h1>My First Heading For Say…</h1>

<p>{{welcome_msg}}</p>

</body>

</html>

username = username
user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)
# Log the user in.
login(request, user)
return HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_to)
else:
form = authentication_form()
request.session.set_test_cookie()
if Site._meta.installed:
current_site = Site.objects.get_current()
else:
current_site = RequestSite(request)
return render_to_response(‘login.html’,locals(), context_instance=RequestContext(request))

 

85. How Django processes a request?
Ans: When a user requests a page from your Django-powered site, this is the algorithm the system follows to determine which Python code to execute:
Django determines the root URLconf module to use. Ordinarily, this is the value of the ROOT_URLCONF setting, but if the incoming HttpRequest object has an attribute called urlconf (set by middleware request processing), its value will be used in place of the ROOT_URLCONF setting.
Django loads that Python module and looks for the variable urlpatterns. This should be a Python list, in the format returned by the function django.conf.urls.patterns()
Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first one that matches the requested URL.

Once one of the regexes matches, Django imports and calls the given view, which is a simple Python function (or a class based view). The view gets passed an HttpRequest as its first argument and any values captured in the regex as remaining arguments.

If no regex matches, or if an exception is raised during any point in this process, Django invokes an appropriate error-handling view.

86. How to filter latest record by date in Django?
Ans: Messages(models.Model):
     message_from = models.ForeignKey(User,related_name=”%(class)s_from”)
message_to = models.ForeignKey(User,related_name=”%(class)s_to”)
message=models.CharField(max_length=140,help_text=”Your message”)
created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
class Meta:
db_table = ‘messages’

Query:messages = Messages.objects.filter(message_to = user).order_by(‘-created_on’)[0]

Output:

message_from | message_to  | message                 | created_on

91. How would you pronounce Django?
Ans: Django is pronounced JANG-oh. Here D is silent.

 

92. How does Django work?
Ans: Django can be broken into many components:

Models.py file: This file defines your data model by extending your single line of code into full database tables and add a pre-built administration section to manage content.

Urls.py file: It uses regular expression to capture URL patterns for processing.

Views.py file: It is the main part of Django. The actual processing happens in view.
When a visitor lands on Django page, first Django checks the URLs pattern you have created and uses information to retrieve the view. After that view processes the request, querying your database if necessary, and passes the requested information to template.
After that the template renders the data in a layout you have created and displays the page.

 

93. Which foundation manages Django web framework?
Ans: Django web framework is managed and maintained by an independent and non-profit organization named Django Software Foundation (DSF).

Project
_init_.py
manage.py
settings.py
urls.py

98. What are the inheritance styles in Django?
Ans: There are three possible inheritance styles in Django:

1) Abstract base classes: This style is used when you only want parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type out for each child model.

2) Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used if you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table.

3) Proxy models: This style is used, if you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields.

99. How can you set up the database in Djanago?
Ans: A: To set up a database in Django, you can use the command edit mysite/setting.py , it is a normal python module with module level representing Django settings.
By default, Django uses SQLite database. It is easy for Django users because it doesn’t require any other type of installation. In the case of other database you have to the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to match your database connection settings.

Engines: you can change database by using ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ , ‘django.db.backeneds.mysql’, ‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’ and so on

Name: The name of your database. In the case if you are using SQLite as your database, in that case database will be a file on your computer, Name should be a full absolute path, including file name of that file.
Note: You have to add setting likes setting like Password, Host, User, etc. in your database, if you are not choosing SQLite as your database.

100. What does the Django templates contain?
Ans: A template is a simple text file. It can create any text-based format like XML, CSV, HTML, etc. A template contains variables that get replaced with values when the template is evaluated and tags (%tag%) that controls the logic of the template.

101. Is Django a content management system (CMS)?
Ans: No, Django is not a CMS. Instead, it is a Web framework and a programming tool that makes you able to build websites.

102.What is the use of session framework in Django?
Ans: The session framework facilitates you to store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site visitor basis. It stores data on the server side and abstracts the receiving and sending of cookies. Session can be implemented through a piece of middleware.

103. Explain Django Admin Interface?
Ans. The Django Admin interface is predefined interface made to fulfill the need of web developers as they won’t need to make another admin panel which is time-consuming and expensive.

Django Admin is application imported from django.contrib packages. It is operated by the organization itself and thus  doesn’t need the extensive frontend.

Admin interface of Django has its own user authentication and most of the general features. It also offers lots of advanced features like authorization access, managing different models, CMS (Content Management System), etc.

106. Which architectural pattern does Django follow?
Ans. Django follows Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.

The graph below shows the MVT based control flow.

Request is made by the user for a resource to the Django, Django works as a controller and check to the available resource in URL.

When the mapping of URL is found , a view is called that interact with model and template, it renders a template.

After that Django responds back to the user and sends a template as a response.


107. Explain Django architecture.
Ans. Django follows MVT (Model View Template) pattern. It is slightly different from MVC.

Model: It is the data access layer. It contains everything about the data, i.e., how to access it, how to validate it, its behaviors and the relationships between the data.

Let’s see an example. We are creating  Employee model who has two fields first_name and last_name.

from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):

first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

View: It is the business logic layer. This layer contains the logic that accesses the model and defers to the appropriate template. It is like a bridge between the model and the template.

import datetime

# Create your views here.

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):

now = datetime.datetime.now()

html = “&lt;html&gt;&lt;body><h3>Now time is %s.</h3>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html>” % now

return HttpResponse(html)    # rendering the template in HttpResponse

Template: It is a presentation layer. This layer contains presentation-related decisions, i.e., how something should be displayed on a Web page or other type of document.

For the configuration of the templates, we have to provide some entries in settings.py file.

TEMPLATES = [

{

‘BACKEND’: ‘django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates’,

‘DIRS’: [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,’templates’)],

‘APP_DIRS’: True,

‘OPTIONS’: {

‘context_processors’: [

‘django.template.context_processors.debug’,

‘django.template.context_processors.request’,

‘django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth’,

‘django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages’,

],

},

},

]

 

108. Explain the working of Django?
Ans. Django can be broken into following components:

Models.py : Models.py  file will define your data model by extending your single line of code into full database tables and add a pre-built administration section to manage content.

Urls.py : Uses a regular expression to capture URL patterns for processing.

Views.py : This is main part of Django. The presentation logic is defined in this.

When a visitor visits  Django page, first Django checks the URLs pattern you have created and use this information to retrieve the view. Then it is the responsibility of view to processes the request, querying your database if necessary, and passes the requested information to a template.

Then template renders the data in a layout you have created and displayed the page.

121. What are the two important parameters in signals?
Ans. Two important parameters in signals are:

Receiver: It specifies the callback function which connected to the signal.

Sender: It specifies a particular sender from where a signal is received.

122. How to handle URLs in Django?
In order to handle URL in Django, django.urls module is used by the Django framework.

Given below is the urls.py file of the project, lets see how it looks:

// urls.py

from django.contrib import admin

from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [

path(‘admin/’, admin.site.urls),

]

We can see that,  Django  has already mentioned a URL here for the admin.  Function path takes the first argument as a route of string or regex type.

Argument view is a view function which is used to return a response (template) to the user.

Module django.urls contains various functions, path(route,view,kwargs,name) is one of those which is used to map the URL and call the specified view.

 

123. What is Django Session?
Ans. In Django session is a mechanism to store information on the server side during the interaction with the web application. Session stores in the database and also allows file-based and cache based sessions,  by default,

124 Explainthe role of Cookie in Django?
Ans. Cookie is nothing but a small piece of information which is stored in the client browser. Cookies are used to store user’s data in a file permanently (or for the specified time). There is an  expiry date and time for each cookie and removes automatically when gets expire. There are built-in methods to set and fetch cookie provided by Django.

set_cookie() method is used to set a cookie and get() method is used to get the cookie.

request.COOKIES[‘key’] is an array which canbe used to get cookie values.

from django.shortcuts import render

from django.http import HttpResponse

def setcookie(request):

response = HttpResponse(“Cookie Set”)

response.set_cookie(‘java-tutorial’, ‘javatpoint.com’)

return response

def getcookie(request):

tutorial  = request.COOKIES[‘java-tutorial’]

return HttpResponse(“java tutorials @: “+  tutorial);

imports your settings.py file and Django’s exception classes.
loads all the middleware classes it finds in the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES or MIDDLEWARES(depending on Django version) tuple located in settings.py
builds four lists of methods which handle processing of request, view, response, and exception.
loops through the request methods, running them in order
resolves the requested URL
loops through each of the view processing methods
calls the view function (usually rendering a template)
processes any exception methods
loops through each of the response methods, (from the inside out, reverse order from request middlewares)
finally builds a return value and calls the callback function to the web server
